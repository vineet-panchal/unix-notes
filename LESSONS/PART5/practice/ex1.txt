1. write a shell program called clean that removes all files called
"core" from your directory structure, and then removes all files that
have size 0 (0 bytes) from your dir structure. That's your WHOLE
dir structure, not just the current dir.
(note: "find" can find files that are zero bytes long)

#/bin/bash
find ~/. -type f -name "core" 2>/dev/null | xargs rm
find ~/. -empty -type f 2>/dev/null       | xargs rm

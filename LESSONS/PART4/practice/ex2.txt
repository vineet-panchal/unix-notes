HMWK:
Write a shell program named paTest.sh which expects any number of command
line arguments (CLAs). paTest.sh prompts the user for a list of argument
numbers. It then passes this list to a function named printargs which
prints the values of those argument numbers of paTest.sh. e.g.,
> paTest.sh one two three four five six seven eight
Enter the argument numbers you would like to print: 3 4 7
three
four
seven
>

ANSW:
#!/bin/bash
printargs () {
  #prints various command line arguments of its calling program,
  #where the argument numbers are sent as arguments to printargs
  for i ; do
    echo "${A[$(($i-1))]}"
  done
}

A=("$@")         #set array A to be all the positional parameters
                 #didnt line them up just to mess with you
echo -en "Enter the argument numbers you would like to print: "
read args
printargs $args    #eg, if args is "2 4 5" this is: printargs 2 4 5
exit 0

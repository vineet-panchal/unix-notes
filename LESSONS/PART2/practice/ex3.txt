HMWK:
1. Use the "find" command to list all entries in directory /bin
that start with the letter "m".
2. What would happen if we did not put
a name such as "*.jav" in quotes in the find command? Make sure you have
some .jav files in your directory and try it out.
3a. Look at the man pages for "find" to determine what the option
"-mtime" does in the find command. Then...
Figure out a sequence of commands (involving a find, temp file and a grep)
to display those FILES in the current directory whose contents were
changed within the last 24 hours and whose names contain the string "tst".
3b. How would you do 3a using a pipe and no temporary files?
4a. Make a shell program to do question 3 above. Call your program tstRecent
Your program should delete any temporary files it creates.
Test it to make sure your program works.
4b. Rewrite your program from 4a to use pipes instead of temp files.
5. Use the man pages to find out how find's -maxdepth option works. Use
-maxdepth 1 to list all entries in the given directory only (not the whole filetree)


ANSW:
1.
find /bin -name "m*"
2.
touch a.jav bb.jav ccc.jav
find . -name *.jav
#get error message saying used find command incorectly. This is because shell
#first expands the *.jav before running the command. The command that is really
#run is: find . -name a.jav bb.jav ccc.jav
#So find complains, because it expects just one pattern to match after -name, but
#you gave it 3 files instead of 1 pattern.
3a.
man find   #use /mtime to search for mtime, and then keep typing / to repeat
           #the search. Once you find its description, read about it.
           #Eventually, you will see description for  -mtime n
find . -mtime 0 -type f >tempfile1       #files modified in last 24 hours
grep -v '.*/.*/' tempfile1 >tempfile2    #this omits lines that contain more than one /
                                         #so only files in CURRENT dir are shown (none
                                         #are shown from subdirectories)
grep tst tempfile2                       #show only those with tst in name
3b.
find . -mtime 0 -type f | grep -v '.*/.*/' | grep tst

4a.
> cat tstRecent
#!/bin/bash
find . -mtime 1 -type f >tempfile1
grep -v '.*/.*/' tempfile1 >tempfile2
grep tst tempfile2
rm tempfile[12]
>
>./tstRecent  #can use ls -l to check when files were modified

4b.
> cat tstRecentNoTemps
#!/bin/bash
find . -mtime 1 -type f | grep -v '.*/.*/' | grep tst
>
>./tstRecentNoTemps  #can use ls -l to check when files were modified

5.
find . -maxdepth 1
Try this:
cd /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes
Notice the different outputs you get with the 2 commands:
find . -maxdepth 1
find .
Note that in question 4 above we could have omitted a grep if we had added -maxdepth 1
to the find command.

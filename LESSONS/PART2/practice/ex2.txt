HMWK: In the shell, is grep '[A-Za-z][A-Za-z]*' fname  the same as
grep -i '[A-Z]*' fname ? Why or why not?
Why do you think "\<" and \>" are used instead of simply "<" and ">" for
beginning/end of line?
For questions 1-6 below, write a different shell program.
1. list all lines in file fname containing the string "dog";
2. list all lines in fname containing the word "dog";
3. list all lines in fname containing the string "dog" at the beginning of
   a line;
4. list all lines in fname containing the word "dog" at the beginning of a line.
5. list all lines in fname containing exactly 6 "a"s in a row.
6. list all lines in fname containing one or more words that start with 93 and
   end in a sequence of any number of W (not 0)
7. Give 2 different grep commands that will list lines of fname that
   end in a lower-case vowel.
8. Use the man page to find the option of grep that shows the matched string
   in a different color. Try it.
9. How would you change your program for #1 above so that instead of doing grep
   directly from the file, it cat`s the file, then pipes that to grep which
   greps from stdin?
10. Print the first 3 lines of AlanTuringBio80 that contain the string 'machine'
   (in any case). Use grep, pipe(s), head


ANSW:
No. The second one also finds blank lines. The first one says show lines containing
     at least one alpha character. The second says show lines that DON'T contain
     a string of upper-case letters (this will include the null string, thus, the
     blank lines.)
If we just used < and >, the shell would think these were input and output redirection.
   Using \ before < and > protects them from shell interpretation, and sends literal < and >
   to the grep command.

For 1-8--the programs go into a file with u+x perms

For 1.
#!/bin/bash
grep "dog" fname

For 2.
#!/bin/bash
grep "\<dog\>" fname

For 3.
#!/bin/bash
grep "^dog" fname

For 4.
#!/bin/bash
grep "^\<dog\>" fname

For 5.
#!/bin/bash
grep "aaaaaaaa" fname

For 6.
#!/bin/bash
grep "\<93[^ ]*WW*\>" fname
#grep '\<93[^ ]*W\{1,\}\>' fname

For 7.
grep "[aeiou]$" fname
egrep 'a$|e$|i$|o$|u$' fname

For 8:
man grep   #use / to search for color and find option --color
grep --color dog /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/u1.txt

For 9.
#!/bin/bash
#grep "dog" fname
cat fname | grep "dog"

For 10.
grep -i machine AlanTuringBio80 | head -3

START OF WEEK 2 of Linux

<<< FILE TIMESTAMP >>>
  -The up to date file is: /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/
  -If you are viewing your own copy, check it is up to date
  -If you are viewing from a link in the Course Outline, be aware it may be outdated.



<<< PIPES >>>

a pipe  |  connects stdout of one command to stdin of another

e.g.,
  cd /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/Programs/linux
  ls |  more             # lists all files in current dir, one
                         # screen at a time
  ls -lt | head          # lists the 10 most recently modified
                         # files in this dir

  ls -lt | head >outfile # prints output into file outfile

  last | head            #show first 10 logins on this machine since wtmp
                         #last output has oldest at end. 

  #print line 54 of AlanTuringBio80 
  cat AlanTuringBio80 | head -54 | tail -1

  #print line 54 in reverse character order
  cat AlanTuringBio80 | head -54 | tail -1 | rev


  #print the 18-20th-last lines of AlanTuringBio80 
  tac AlanTuringBio80 | head -20 | tail -3 | tac
  cat AlanTuringBio80 | tail -20 | head -3


pipes contribute to shell`s usefulness and flexibility
  -no need to create new commands to perform a task--can combine
   existing commands to perform more complex tasks
  -no need for "temp" files



<< TEE COMMAND >>

saves the data passing through the pipe
writes stdin to stdout AND to a given file

e.g.,   changing: cat AlanTuringBio80 | head -54 | tail -1
        to:       cat AlanTuringBio80 | head -54 | tee first54 | tail -1
        the same, but ALSO saves first 54 lines in file first54



<<< GLOB CONSTRUCTS, METACHARACTERS AND OTHER SPECIAL CHARACTERS >>>


?  *  [   ]              #some glob constructs
                         #man bash search for: Pathname Expansion

saves typing,  time
encourages good naming conventions

when shell encounters a glob construct:
  -first expands construct to matching entries
  -then does resulting command

*       string of characters (incl. null string)
?       single character
[...]   single char from set of chars within the brackets

e.g., assume /home/dwoit has 7 files:

                lab1.jav lb2.jav new.c pie.c prog1.c prog2.c top.c

        /home/dwoit> ls *.c
                                new.c pie.c prog1.c prog2.c top.c
        /home/dwoit> ls *
                                lab1.jav lb2.jav new.c pie.c prog1.c
                                prog2.c  top.c

        /home/dwoit> ls prog?.c
                                prog1.c prog2.c
        /home/dwoit> ls p*.c
                                prog1.c prog2.c pie.c
        /home/dwoit> ls ???.*
                                lb2.jav new.c pie.c top.c
        /home/dwoit> ls prog[123].c
                                prog1.c prog2.c
        /home/dwoit> ls prog[abc].c     #since no expansion, uses literal string
                                ls: cannot access 'prog[abc].c': No such file or directory
        /home/dwoit> ls [m-s]*          # all files starting with one of these:
                                        # m n o p q r s
                                new.c pie.c prog1.c prog2.c

        [1-58]          matches any single char in 1 2 3 4 5 8
        [A-Za-z]        matches any single char in A,B,...Z,a,b,...z
                             systems may differ depending on $LC_COLLATE
                             or globalasciiranges, etc.
                             see man bash search for Pattern Matching
        [!ABC]          matches any single char *except* A, B or C
        [!a-z0-4]       matches any single char *except* a,b,...z,0,1,2,3,4
                        (in some bash, ^ can be used instead of !)

        These Character Classes can be used within [ ]
        [:alnum:]  [:alpha:]  [:blank:]  [:cntrl:]
        [:digit:]  [:graph:]  [:lower:]  [:print:]
        [:punct:]  [:space:]  [:upper:]  [:xdigit:]

        note    [:upper:]   is A-Z
        so     [[:upper:]]  is [A-Z]

        /home/dwoit> ls [[:upper:]]* matches files whose name starts
                                     with an upper-case letter A-Z

        What is the difference between these?:
        ls [[:upper:][:upper:]]*
        ls [[:upper:]][[:upper:]]*

        First one matches files whose name starts with an upper case letter
        Second one matches files whose name starts with two upper case letters

Other special characters:

\       protects the character following it from being expanded
\       at end of line, means continued on next line (see program trump_born.sh)
;       separates commands: mkdir newDir ; cd newDir ; touch newFile
~       your home directory name  (/home/dwoit for prof)

~usr    the home dir of user with userid "usr"
~-      your previous working dir  (note in bash  cd - same as cd ~-)
~+      your current working dir

      /home/dwoit>  echo list java files by: ls \*.jav
                    list java files by: ls *.jav
      /home/dwoit>  echo list java files by: ls *.jav
                    list java files by: ls lab1.jav lb2.jav

     from any dir,  ls ~    lists your home dir (/home/dwoit for prof)
     from any dir,  cd ~/bin changes into dir /home/dwoit/bin for prof

toggle between 2 dirs with "cd ~-" (or with "cd -" in bash)
      /home/dwoit>     cd bin
      /home/dwoit/bin> cd -
      /home/dwoit>     cd -
      /home/dwoit/bin>

execute a pgm called myprog in dmason`s dir cps209
      /home/dwoit>    ~dmason/cps209/myprog #assuming correct perms:
                                            # x on dirs, and 
                                            # x  on myprog (if a compiled program), or
                                            # rx on myprog (if a shell program)
      /home/dwoit/bin>   echo my working dir is ~+
                         my working dir is /home/dwoit/bin


could use quotes instead of escape character \
all these print this on stdout: list the java files in this dir by *.jav

      /home/dwoit>  echo list the java files in this dir by \*.jav
      /home/dwoit>  echo list the java files in this dir by "*".jav
      /home/dwoit>  echo list the java files in this dir by "*.jav"
      /home/dwoit>  echo "list the java files in this dir by *.jav"



<< PATTERNS AND REGULAR EXPRESSIONS IN SHELL >>

The extended globs below require bash option extglob to be set.
To see which shell options are set:
echo $BASHOPTS
If extglob is not set, set it by:
shopt -s extglob


 *(exp)           0 or more occurrences of exp
 +(exp)           1 or more occurrences of exp
 ?(exp)           0 or 1 occurrences of exp
 @(exp1|exp2|...) exp1 or exp2 or ...
 !(exp)           entries that do NOT match exp

e.g.,
 if you had files in the current dir:
     A  Ax  Axxx  Axxxx  Ay  X  X.bak  x  xx  xxxx
 then
  shopt -s extglob   if necessary
  ls A*(x)           prints A Ax Axxx Axxxx
  ls A*(xx)          prints A  Axxxx
  ls A+(x)           prints Ax Axxx Axxxx
  ls A?(x)           prints A Ax
  ls X?(.bak)        prints X X.bak
  ls @(*xx|*ak)      prints Axxx  Axxxx  X.bak  xx  xxxx
  ls !(@(*xx|*ak))   prints A  Ax  Ay  X  x

Note: See "man bash" and search for "Pattern Matching"
      for help on globs, patterns, etc.



<<< INTERACTIVE SHELL USE >>>

-typing on command line
-one-time task
-prototyping


<<< SHELL PROGRAMS (SHELL SCRIPTS, SHELLS) >>>

-executable file containing shell commands
-can run like a program (type its name on command line)


Why?
  -task is complex
  -repeat it later
  -repeat it in different context (arguments)

Typically file containing shell program has .sh suffix
but in cps393 we sometimes omit suffix


#!/bin/bash
#source: showSource.sh
#shell program to list all java and c files in current directory
echo -n "Current directory is: "
pwd
echo "C files are:"
ls *.c
echo "Java files are:"
ls *.jav
exit 0

To run:
  Make sure it is executable (x permissions for user running it), then
  type its name on command line after ./

  If you own the program, need rx perms for user
  If you don`t own it,    need rx perms for other


  > cd /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/Programs/linux
  > ls -l showSource.sh
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 dwoit cps393 203 Jul  2 14:57 showSource.sh
  > ./showSource.sh
  Current directory is: /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/Programs/linux
  C files are:
  blah.c
  Java files are:
  blah.jav  color.jav  pgm1.jav  TextStackViewer.jav  ttt.jav  VisibleStack.jav  xyz.jav
  >


  > cd     #for prof
  > cp /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/Programs/linux/showSource.sh showSourceCopy.sh
  > ./showSourceCopy.sh
  Current directory is: /home/dwoit
  C files are:
  ls: cannot access '*.c': No such file or directory
  Java files are:
  DAC.jav skipList.jav



Shell Script Arguments:
            $1  $2  $3  etc.
            $0  name of shell pgm
            $#  the number of args passed
            $@  lists args as one string: "arg1 arg2 ..."
            $*  lists args as separate:   "arg1" "arg2" ...

#!/bin/bash
#source: prnargs.sh
#shell pgm to print out its first 2 args
echo The first argument is:  $1
echo The second argument is: $2
echo dollar zero is: $0
exit 0


  /home/dwoit>  cp /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/Programs/linux/prnargs.sh .
  /home/dwoit>  ./prnargs.sh  "Hello there" world
  The first argument is: Hello there
  The second argument is: world
  dollar zero is: ./prnargs.sh


  Note: spacing in program differs from spacing in output
  Why?  echo squeezes multiple whitespace to single space


  Could line up spacing with quotes or tabs:
       echo "The first argument is:  $1"
       echo "The second argument is: $2"

       echo -e "The first argument is:\t$1"
       echo -e "The second argument is:\t$2"


  Could leave out the ./ if current dir in your path.
      e.g.,    /home/dwoit> prnargs.sh   (instead of ./prnargs.sh)
      If it says prnargs.sh "not found" can fix by adding the current dir to your path
         e.g., in your .profile or .bash_profile or .bashrc at the end put:
           PATH=$PATH::
           export PATH
         Must login again for it to take effect.
         Now, whenever you login, current dir always in path.


<<< FILTERS >>>

filter: refines or transforms its input to produce (usually different) output
most shell commands are filters.

             stdin -------> filter --------> stdout

e.g.,  more <file1
         transforms sequence of characters from file1 (its input)
         into the same sequence but with  pagination
       rev
         transforms each stdin line to line in reverse
         (remember ctrl-d to end)
       uniq
         filters out duplicate lines


e.g.,  more <file1
         transforms sequence of characters from file1 (its input)
         into the same sequence but with  pagination
       rev
         transforms each stdin line to line in reverse
         (remember ctrl-d to end)
       uniq
         filters out duplicate lines

Some filters filter input from either stdin or file(s)


<< GREP  (GLOBAL REGULAR EXPRESSION PRINT) >>
        (globally search for a regular expression and print it)


grep string filename(s)
                string:         the string to search for
                filename(s):    one or more files to search in
                result:         displays lines of file(s)
                                        that that contain string
grep string
                searches stdin instead of file(s)
                sends to stdout lines of stdin that contain string
                ctrl-d "ends" stdin when you are typing on keyboard


e.g.  grep  'applet' lab1.jav lab2.jav
        sends to stdout (screen) those lines of files lab1.jav and
        lab2.jav that contain the string applet
        /home/jchan>    grep 'applet' lab1.jav lab2.jav
                                lab1.jav:       applet.init();
                                lab1.jav:       applet.start();
                                lab2.jav:       applet.num=6;

e.g. Which course notes mention touch?
     Try searching for 'touch' in all u?.txt files:

     /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes> grep 'touch' u?.txt
     u1.txt:     ls, cd, pwd, cat, more, cp, rm, mkdir, rmdir, mv, wc, touch,
     u1.txt:touch   creates file(s) or updates modification time(s)
     u1.txt:        /home/dwoit> touch abc def ghi
     u1.txt:        /home/dwoit> touch f1 f2 f3 f4
     u2.txt:;       separates commands: mkdir newDir ; cd newDir ; touch newFile


Note: single quotes are good for now. Once we study variables, you
      may have reason to use double quotes around the search string.


Options:
-i  ignore case of search string
-v  print lines *not* matching search string
-x  search string must match ENTIRE line
-w  search string must match a whole word
-l  print only names of files that match, not individual lines
   (man grep gives all the options)

Regular Expressions:
The grep search string above can be specified as a regex, i.e.,
    can contain metacharacters for pattern matching

.       any character, except newline (like ? in glob)
*       0 or more repetitions of previous character (unlike glob)
^       beginning of line
$       end of line
[...]   any character inside the brackets (like glob)
[^...]  any character not inside the brackets (like ! in glob)
\{m\}   exactly m repetitions of previous character
\{m,\}  at least m repetitions of previous character
\{m,n\} any number of repetitions of prev char between m and n inclusive
\<      beginning of word
\>      end of word
        remember to quote these as in: grep '\<theWord\>' a_file
\(str\) group string str into a substring

To match an actual metacharacter such as . protect it: \.

e.g.,  searching in file fname (and later stdin):
grep '^Assignment' fname    # lines starting with Assignment
grep -v '^Assignment' fname # lines not starting with Assignment
grep 'Assignment$' fname    # lines ending with Assignment
grep 'd.g' fname            # lines containing dag, dbg, dcg, d0g, d1g, etc
grep 'su*m' fname           # lines containing sm, sum, suum, suuum, etc
grep 'suu*m' fname          # lines containing     sum, suum, suuum, etc
grep '\<so\>' fname         # the word so (vs. social, absolute)
grep '[A-Za-z][A-Za-z]*' fname  # lines containing ANY alpha string (no blank
                                # lines, no lines with only digits, etc)
grep '^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z]*$' fname  # lines containing ONLY alpha characters
grep 'xyz\.[^ ]* '         # lines containing string xyz followed by a dot
                           # followed by 0 or more non-spaces, then one space
                           # e.g., "xyz. " "xyz.w "  "xyz.ta "  etc
grep 'xyz\.w\{2,3\}X'      # lines containing xyz.wwX or xyz.wwwX
grep 'A\(bc\)\{2,3\}D'     # lines containing AbcbcD or AbcbcbcD
grep -x "abc"              # lines that contain exactly and only abc


Extended Regular Expressions:

use grep -E  (or egrep, but deprecated)

|       OR
+       1 or more repetitions of previous character
( and ) do not need escaping (substring)
{ and } do not need escaping (repetition)
\n      backreference: \1 replaced by substring 1, \2 by substring 2, etc

e.g.,
grep -E 'dog|cat|bird'         # lines with at least 1 of dog, cat, or bird
grep -E '[A-Za-z]+'            # lines with at least one alpha char
grep    '[A-Za-z][A-Za-z]*'    # same as above if no -E option
grep -E 'xyz\.w{2,3}X'         # lines containing xyz.wwX or xyz.wwwX
grep -E 'A(ab){2,3}D'          # lines containing AababD or AabababD
grep -E 'A([aei]+)B(.*)C\2\1'  # lines containing strings such as:
                               # AieiBxyzCxyziei  or  AiBCi etc

<< FIND  (LIST ALL FILES AND DIRS MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA) >>


   e.g., this lists all java files in portion of the filesystem
         rooted at /home/dwoit:


    find /home/dwoit -name "*.jav"
          ^           ^
          |           |
          |           |
          |           match any entry with name *.jav (glob)
          dir to begin search (whole subtree of filesystem starting here)


     find . -type f          # only FILES in filetree under current dir (.)
     find . -type d          # only DIRECTORIES in filetree under .

     find /usr -name tali 2>/dev/null        #if takes too long ctrl-c and... 

     find /usr/[!c]* -name tali 2>/dev/null  #eliminate /usr/courses
                                             #or use -prune (see below)

     find . -type d -perm -g+r,u+r   # dirs readable by BOTH owner and group 
     find . -type d -perm /g+r,u+r   # dirs readable by EITHER or BOTH owner & group
     find . -type d -perm /a+w       # dirs with at least one write bit set
     find . -type d ! -perm /a+x     # dirs having no x perms at all
     LOTS of ways to specify perms--see man find

     cd /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/Programs/c
     find . -name "m*.c"     #get matches from ./c1 ./c2 ./c3 and ./c4
     #eliminate ./c2 from the search using -prune:
     find . -name c2 -prune -o -name "m*.c" -print
                             #-o means "or". 
                             #need -print to print the one that recurses
                             #otherwise dir name ./c2 itself is still printed
                             #-print is normally implicit. However, if explicitly
                             # include it, then only commands WITH -print get printed
                             # and not any other commnds (just right-side of -o and 
                             # not left side, since left has no -print)
     #could eliminate /usr/courses from tali search using -prune
     find /usr -name courses -prune -o -name tali -print 2>/dev/null


   LOTS of options to find. Some useful ones are:
   -newer xyz   #list entries that have been modified more recently than file xyz
   -maxdepth 1  #descend only 1 level down directories (can use any integer)

   Why quote arguments to -name?:
      If argument has unquoted glob constructs, bash EXPANDS it first
      and then sends result to find. But that`s not what we wanted:
      /home/dwoit/testdir> ls
                           abc.c  dir1/  dir2/  dir3/
      #correct way to find all entries matching name pattern a*.c
      /home/dwoit/testdir> find . -name 'a*.c'
      ./dir1/a1.c
      ./dir1/a2.c
      ./dir2/arc.c
      ./dir3/am.c
      ./abc.c
      #INcorrect way. Expands to: find . -name abc.c 
      /home/dwoit/testdir> find . -name a*.c
      ./abc.c
      /home/dwoit/testdir>



<< MORE ADVANCED HEAD, TAIL OPTIONS >>

Saw previously:
  head -2 f1 f2 f3  #sends to stdout first 2 lines of f1, f2, f3 
  head -19          #sends to stdout first 19 lines of stdin 

option -n-X for head and -n+X for tail:

  # sends to stdout all lines of f1 starting at line 3
  tail -n+3 f1

  # sends to stdout all but the last 2 lines of f1
  head -n-2 f1

  #print list of recent logins minus the final 2 lines
  last | head -n-2          #last logins without the final 2 lines


  #note, tail -n-3 is same as tail -3
  #      head -n+2 is same as head -2


(options are in man pages. Lots for tail. )


#!/bin/bash
#program to print line 6 of vimSummary.txt
head -6 /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/vimSummary.txt | tail -1

Copy the code into a file called showline and modify it as follows:
      Make it able to show ANY line of ANY file, with
      line and file given as a command line argument, as in:
      ./showline 5  myfile  #to show line 5  of file myfile
      ./showline 54 dog     #to show line 54 of file dog


<< CUT, PASTE COMMANDS >>

cut     extract specified input columns
paste   combine input columns

both take input from stdin or files

cut -c8 myfile  # outputs 8th column of each line of myfile
cut -c5-7,25-   # outputs columns 5,6,7,25... of each line of stdin
cut -f2 myfile  # outputs second field of each line of myfile 
                #         (assumes fields delimited by one tab)
cut -d' ' -f3   # outputs field 3, fields delimited by one space

paste f1 f2     # linei to stdout contains linei of f1 followed by
                # a tab followed by linei of f2
paste -d' ' f1 f2  # uses single space instead of tab


Aside:
   If you have things separated by tabs in a file, and want the tabs
     converted to spaces, use the command: expand
   cat -A will show tabs, newlines, etc. (see man page)


Some shell programs:

#!/bin/bash
#source profs.sh
#prints names of profs.sh logged in
who | grep dwoit | cut -c1-8 | uniq
who | grep eharley | cut -c1-8 | uniq
who | grep aabhari | cut -c1-8 | uniq
who | grep -w mes | cut -c1-8 | uniq #string in other userids
exit 0
#or who | grep -Ew "dwoit|eharley|mes" | cut -c1-8 | sort -u


Try this: use any of ls, cut, sort, uniq, head, tail and pipes
to get a listing of all the different GROUPS entries belong to
in the current directory. List each group only once.


#!/bin/bash
#source prof1.sh
#prints names of a prof logged in
#name supplied as command line argument
who | grep -w $1 | cut -c1-8 | uniq

See what happens if you use prof1.sh without an argument.
How do you fix it? (hint: use double quotes in grep)



Note 2 pipes and line continuation character \

#!/bin/bash
#source: trump_born.sh
echo "Donald Trump's Birthday: "
lynx -dump "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" 2>/dev/null | \
      grep "Trump.*born" | head -1
echo ""
exit 0

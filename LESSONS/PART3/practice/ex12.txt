       Write a shell program that tells you how many windows a user
       has open. Note that each open window is assigned a unique port
       number, which you can see with the who command. e.g.,
       > who
       dwoit    pts/0   ....
       eharley  pts/3   ....
       dwoit    pts/2   ....
       This shows dwoit has 2 windows open (pts/0 and pts/2)
       The user is given as a command line argument to your program ($1).

#!/bin/bash
echo "$1 has $(who | grep "$1" | tr -s " " " " \
      | cut -d' ' -f2 | wc -l) open windows"

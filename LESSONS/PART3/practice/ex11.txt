4. Write a program called biggest.sh that takes any number of arguments.
For all the arguments that are files, it finds
the file with the most words in it, and prints a line such as:
 File whatever has largest number of words (37)
assuming the file called "whatever" has 37 words, which is more (or the
same) as any other files in the current directory.
If no arguments were valid files, then the following
line should be printed to stderr:
biggest.sh: no valid filenames were specified
You may find the wc command useful, especially wc -w

#!/bin/bash
validFiles="NO"
typeset -i maxWords=0
typeset -i aFileWords=0
for aFile ; do
  if [  -f $aFile -a  -r $aFile ] ; then
     validFiles="YES"
     aFileWords="`wc -w $aFile | cut -d' ' -f1`"
     if [ $aFileWords -gt $maxWords ] ; then
        maxWords=$aFileWords
        maxFile=$aFile
     fi
  fi
done
if [ $validFiles = "NO" ] ; then
   echo "$0: no valid filenames were specified" >/dev/stderr
   exit 1
fi
echo "File $maxFile has the largest number of words (${maxWords})"
exit 0

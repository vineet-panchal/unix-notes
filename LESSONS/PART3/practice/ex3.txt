HMWK: Re-write shell program ff.sh above so that it does something
      reasonable when the user invokes it without a command argument
      (or with a null argument as in:  ff ""  )


ANSW:
#!/bin/bash
if [ -z "$1" ] ; then
   echo "argument missing" >/dev/stderr
   exit 1
fi
if [ "`grep $1 f1`" ]
then
   echo string $1 is contained in file f1
else
   echo string $1 is not contained in file f1
fi
exit 0

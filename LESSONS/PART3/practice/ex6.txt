HMWK: 1.write a shell pgm called lst which acts like ls -F, using
      a shell for loop (Note ls -F puts a '/' after dir names and
      a '*' after any files  that are user executable and a '@'
      before any that are symbolic links. Look at 'man bash' or
      'man test' to find the test for symbolic links)
      2. write a shell program called num.sh that prints the number
      of entries in the current directory. USE A LOOP and counter. No pipes.
      3. modify your program nw from previous homework so that if the
      argument is a number larger than the number of entries IN the
      current directory, the following message is printed:
       there are only $num entries in this directory
      The new nw should use your program num from above to assign the
      number of files/dirs to a variable.

1.
#!/bin/bash
for i  ; do
  if [ -d "$i" ]  ; then
     echo "${i}/"
  elif [ -x "$i" ] ; then
     echo "${i}*"
  elif [ -h "$i" ]  ; then
     echo "${i}@"
  else
     echo "${i}"
  fi
done

2.
> cat num
#!/bin/bash
declare -i count=0
for i in $(ls) ; do
   count=count+1
done
echo $count
> #double-check it. These should give same number:
> ls | wc -l
> ./num

3.
#!/bin/bash
if [ -z "$1" ] ; then
  ls -t
else
  numEntries="$(num)"
  if [ "$numEntries" -lt "$1" ]  ; then
     echo there are only $numEntries entries in this directory
  else
     ls -t | head -$1

exit 0

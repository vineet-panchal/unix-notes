HMWK:
1.re-write your homework program called nw.sh (from u2) so that if
no argument is passed, all of your entries in the current dir are printed
(instead of only 10 as before)
2. write a shell program called x that makes your most recently created
   file executable. (Note x has no extension. That is OK).

1.
#!/bin/bash
if [ -z "$1" ] ; then
  ls -t
else
  ls -t | head -$1
fi
exit 0

2.
#!/bin/bash
chmod u+x `ls -t | head -1`

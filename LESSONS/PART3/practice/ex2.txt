HMWK: Write a shell program called sg.sh that takes 2 command line arguments.
      The first argument is a textual string; the second a file name.
      If other than 2 args are supplied it prints on stderr:
      sg.sh: Usage: sg.sh str file
      (the sg.sh is printes so that if you change the name of the program,
      the "Usage line" changes automatically.)
      If the second arg is not a readable file, print on stderr:
      sg.sh: file xxx invalid or not readable
      where "xxx" is arg2
      Your program will return 0 if string is contained somewhere in the
      file, and 1 if something wrong with args, and 2 if string not in
      file (but args OK).  (use grep in your program).

ANSW:
> cat sg.sh
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -ne 2 ] ; then
  echo "$0: Usage: $0 str file" >/dev/stderr
  exit 1
fi
if [ ! -r "$2" ] ; then
  echo "$0: file $2 invalid or not readable" >/dev/stderr
  exit 1
fi
if [ "`grep $1 $2`" ] ; then
  exit 0
else
  exit 2
fi

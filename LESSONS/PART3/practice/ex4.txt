HMWK: Write a shell program that will tell you how long another
user`s session has been idle.
If the user has more than one idle session, just look at the first one.
To see idle time, use the who command with options -H -u.
Idle time is given in minutes. If a user is idle for less than a minute,
a . appears instead of a time.
The program will take a userid as an argument
and will do one of (a), (b), or (c) below:
   (a) print "user userid is not logged in" and exit 1
   (b) print "user userid has been idle at least 1 minute and exit 0
   (c) print "user userid has been idle less than 1 minute and exit 0


ANSW:

#!/bin/bash
#this tells if a user has been on for less than a minute by looking for
#a . for a user`s idle time. As of F23 it would appear in column 42,
#but this could change in subsequent implementations
#!/bin/bash
if [ -z "$1" ] ; then
   echo "Usage: $0 userid" >/dev/stderr
   exit 1
fi
userLine="`who -u -H | grep $1 | head -1`"
if [ -z "$userLine" ] ; then
  echo "user $1 is not logged in"
  exit 1
fi
col42="`who -u -H | grep $1 | head -1 | cut -c42`"
if [ "$col42" = '.' ] ; then
  echo "user $1 has been idle less than 1 minute"
else
  echo "user $1 has been idle at least 1 minute"
fi
exit 0

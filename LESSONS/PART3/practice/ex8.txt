1. write a shell program called numit.sh which reads lines from stdin
  and outputs the lines with line numbers.
  e.g., if stdin was
  this is a line
  this is now another line
  and here is line

  Then numit.sh would print
  1. this is a line
  2. this is now another line
  3. and here is line

  And if file dog contained
  Abcde

  klm
  n
  Then numit.sh <dog  would print
  1. Abcde
  2.
  3. klm
  4. n


#!/bin/bash
typeset -i lineNum=1
while read line ; do
  echo "${lineNum}. $line"
  lineNum=lineNum+1
done

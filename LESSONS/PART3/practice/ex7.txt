0. If the numbers from 1 to 4321 were written out, how many times would the
   digit '5' appear? Write a shell program to figure this out.


#!/bin/bash
seq 4321 | \
  while read -n1 digit; do
     echo $digit
  done | grep -c 5

#!/bin/bash
typeset -i n=1
while [ $n -le  4321 ] ; do
  echo $n
  n=n+1
done | \
  while read -n1 digit; do
     echo $digit
  done | grep -c 5
